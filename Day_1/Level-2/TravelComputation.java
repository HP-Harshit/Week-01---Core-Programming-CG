/*
 * Rewrite the Sample Program 2 with user inputs
Hint => 
Create variables and take user inputs for name, fromCity, viaCity, toCity
Create variables and take user inputs for distances fromToVia and viaToFinalCity in Miles
Create Variables and take time taken 
Finally, print the result and try to understand operator precedence.
